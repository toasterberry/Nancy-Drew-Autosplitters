# Nancy Drew Autosplitters
Autosplitters I've made for various Nancy Drew games.

Most of these autosplitters are written for the disc versions of the game, and will not work out of box with Big Fish or Steam versions. If you would like me to add compatability to one of my autosplitters for a particular version, please contact me in the Nancy Drew Speedrunning Discord server https://discord.gg/6EUkdwZTtX by pinging me in the game's appropriate channel.

The goal is to eventually have fully featured autosplitters for every ND game with a large quantity of useful splits, support for all relevant categories, and decent version compatability.
