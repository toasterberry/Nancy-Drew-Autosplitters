# Nancy Drew Autosplitters
Autosplitters I've made for various Nancy Drew games.

Autosplitters will only work on particular versions of the games. Each platform (Steam, Big Fish, Disc) will  needs its own version, and different disc versions may too. I have no idea which versions I wrote what autosplitter for. Most should be for some disc version.
Autosplitters for games #16+ are finicky, and are not well tested on other machines. 
If you'd like me to make an autosplitter for a game or version that doesn't have one, contact me in the Nancy Drew Speedrunning Discord server https://discord.gg/6EUkdwZTtX by pinging me in the game's appropriate channel, and I'll get one made. If the game has no previous splits, you will be required to provide info for splits if they are wanted.
