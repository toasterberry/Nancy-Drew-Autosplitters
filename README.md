# Nancy Drew Autosplitters
Autosplitters I've made for various Nancy Drew games.

While I try to make these autosplitters compatible with as many versions as possible, I often only have access to the disc versions, so some may not work with versions from Steam and other platforms. If you would like me to add support to one of my autosplitters for a particular version, please contact me in the [Nancy Drew Speedrunning Discord server](https://discord.gg/6EUkdwZTtX) by pinging me in the game's channel.

My goal is to eventually have autosplitters for every Nancy Drew game with a large quantity of useful splits, support for all categories, and full version compatability.
